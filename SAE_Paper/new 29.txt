To bring a **use case view** from the block diagram you shared, we can organize the information to highlight **real-world applications or scenarios** where each powertrain type and test strategy would be relevant. Here's how you can approach it:

---

Use Case View for Power Trains and Test Strategy
1. Combustion Engine (ICE)
- Use Case: Traditional passenger vehicles, commercial trucks.
- Architecture: Distributed ECU, Classic AUTOSAR.
- Testing Focus:
  - Cluster & IVI common features.
  - Domain-specific features like engine diagnostics.
  - KPI measurement for fuel efficiency and emissions.

2. Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV)
- Use Case: Urban mobility, electric cars, fleet vehicles.
- Architecture: Zonal, Adaptive AUTOSAR.
- Testing Focus:
  - Cross-functional features (e.g., battery status in cluster & IVI).
  - Domain-specific features like charging and range estimation.
  - KPI measurement for battery health and energy consumption.

3. Hydrogen ICE
- Use Case: Heavy-duty transport, long-range applications.
- Architecture: Distributed ECU, Classic AUTOSAR.
- Testing Focus:
  - Domain-specific features like hydrogen fuel management.
  - KPI measurement for combustion efficiency and safety.

4. Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle (FCEV)
- Use Case: Clean energy transport, buses, logistics.
- Architecture: Centralized Service-Oriented.
- Testing Focus:
  - Service-oriented diagnostics.
  - KPI measurement for fuel cell performance and energy conversion.

Test Strategy Use Cases

- Test Section 1: Validate shared UI/UX features across vehicle types.
- Test Section 2: Ensure domain-specific logic (e.g., battery vs. fuel).
- Test Section 3: Test integration between systems (e.g., IVI and cluster).
- Test Section 4: Measure performance indicators across domains.
